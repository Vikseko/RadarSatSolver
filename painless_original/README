===== To compile the project =====

- In the PaInleSS home directory use 'make' to compile.

- In the PaInleSS home directory use 'make docs' to compile the documentation.

- In the PaInleSS home directory use 'make clean' to clean.


===== PaInleSS can act as state of the art solvers =====

- glucose-syrup : -solver=glucose -d=4 -shr-strat=1

- hordesat : -solver=lingeling -d=7 -shr-sleep=1500000 -shr-strat=2

- treengeling : -solver=lingeling -lbd-limit=-1 -shr-strat=1 -wkr-strat=2
